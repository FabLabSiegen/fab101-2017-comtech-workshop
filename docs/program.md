### Extended break & demos

Lunch and enough time for hands-on sessions. The organizers will bring at least one 3D printer and lots of demo objects, interactive systems and student projects and the call for contributions should result in more demos/artifacts.


### Afternoon slots

* Digital fabrication is more than just 3d printing
* Fabrication/innovation communities and the common good
* Closing session (discussion, continuation, new project and collaboration ideas, ...)
