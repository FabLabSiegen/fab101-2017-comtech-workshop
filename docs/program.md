We suggest the following program based on a topic driven order of the [accepted submissions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6IVn-EKd-N0bE55aDVEZGVJd0E):
 
##**Introduction Session | 10.00 am - 11.30 am**
The workshop starts at 10.00 am with coffee and a short get to know session, where participants and organizers introduce themselves.
 
##**Presentation Session | 11.45 am - 07.00 pm**
For each presentation of submissions we plan 10 minutes talk time and 10 minutes for a discussion, which is moderated by three questions prepared by the authors. After each presentation block will be time for block-based group discussions.
