The actual program will be based on participant submission. The draft program below is based on the thematic suggestions from the call for contributions and will be updated after all submissions have been reviewed (in June 2017):

###Morning slots

* 3D printing: (New?) socio-technical systems and their appropriation
* 3D printing and education
* 3D printing and Education

### Extended break & demos

Lunch and enough time for hands-on sessions. The organizers will bring at least one 3D printer and lots of demo objects, interactive systems and student projects and the call for contributions should result in more demos/artifacts.


### Afternoon slots

* Digital fabrication is more than just 3d printing
* Fabrication/innovation communities and the common good
* Closing session (discussion, continuation, new project and collaboration ideas, ...)
