# Contributions and proceedings

An overview about the contribution as well as the workshop's proceedings will be published here in an open access format. 

Publication format will be an [International Report on Socio-Informatics](http://www.iisi.de/international-reports-on-socio-informatics-irsi/) - however, depending on contributor interest, we might also go for a Special Issue in a journal. This will be discussed and decided collaboratively at the workshop.
