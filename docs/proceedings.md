# Contributions and proceedings

An overview about the contributions can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6IVn-EKd-N0bE55aDVEZGVJd0E?usp=sharing).

Publication format will be an [International Report on Socio-Informatics](http://www.iisi.de/international-reports-on-socio-informatics-irsi/) - however, depending on contributor interest, we might also go for a Special Issue in a journal. This will be discussed and decided collaboratively at the workshop.
