We welcome all contributions related to (digital) fabrication and common good aspects. Topical suggestions include:

*3D printing: (New?) socio-technical systems and their appropriation:*

* 3D printing and the Maker movement.
* Developments in (desktop / open source) 3D printing.
* Appropriation of 3D printing in practice.
* Fab Labs, schools, hackspaces, company labs - different contexts, different practices?


*3D printing and education:*

* Didactics, pedagogics and 3D printing.
* Innovation and fabrication infrastructures in (educational) organizations.
* Digital fabrication in academic/vocational education.
* UX, joy and motivational aspects in labbased and making-oriented teaching.
* 3D printing in informal activities (e.g. after-school sessions, hobbyist communities, â€¦)


*Digital fabrication and the common good:*

* Between education, activism and economics.
* Community engineering for the common good and humanitarian Makers.
* 3D printing and the impaired.
* Open / peer / commons oriented production on local and global scales.
* (Long-term?) perspectives on (grassroots) activism, ICT and the common good.
* 'ICT4D' and 3D printing.


## Contribution formats

We invite contributors from academia, practice, activism and any other communities interested in workshop goals. There are three formats for contribution:

* **Position Papers** outlining positions, stances and perspectives on 3D printing, digital fabrication and education and/or the common good. Position Papers should be 1-3 pages in [ACM SigConf format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
* **Case studies** describing interesting, novel, provocative or otherwise relevant cases of 3D printing and/or digital fabrication and education and/or the common good. Case studies should be 4 pages maximum in [ACM extended abstract format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
* **Demos and hands-on artifacts/projects** for the extended break. We ask for a brief description (2-3 sentences) of what you intend to bring with you as well as one photo (or sketch, drawing,...). If your demo has special requirements, please also outline them.
