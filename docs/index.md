## About the workshop

3D printing has become an area of intense interest in a variety of contexts in research and practice ranging from industry through education, humanitarian to innovation. At the same time, technologies, materials, usages and appropriation are in constant flux. 3D printing is, however just one of the many facets of digital fabrication, the digitalization of more and more sectors and increasingly community-based innovation and open/commons-oriented engineering practices.

This workshop at [C&T 2017 conference](http://comtech.community/) is intended to illustrate and discuss *cases, positions, concepts and experiences* related to such developments in digital fabrication, especially in 3D printing. We specifically look for contributions highlighting the role of digital fabrication and 3D printing *for the common good and in educational contexts*. Interested in [participating](/participate)?
